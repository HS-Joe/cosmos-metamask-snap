### **`@leapwallet/metamask-cosmos-snap-beta`**

This Snap facilitates signing of Cosmos transactions for chains associated with coin type 118.

> Recommendation: If you're accustomed to using [CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and the OfflineSigner, consider leveraging our cosmos-snap-provider. It streamlines the necessary tasks with minimal code alterations.
