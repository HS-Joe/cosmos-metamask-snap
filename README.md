MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that can customize the wallet experience.

## Snaps is pre-release software

To interact with Snaps, you will need to install [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/), a canary distribution for developers that provides access to upcoming features.
